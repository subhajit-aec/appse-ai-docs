description: Learn what AI Credits are, how they are consumed by AI nodes and Agents, and what happens when they run out.
---

**AI Credits** are the unit of resource consumption for AI-powered features on the appse ai platform. Every time an AI-Enabled Node processes data inside a workflow, or an AI Agent handles a task, AI Credits are deducted from your monthly allowance.

---

## Monthly AI Credit Allowance

Each plan includes a fixed number of AI Credits that reset every month.

| Plan | Monthly AI Credits |
|------|--------------------|
| Free | 20 credits |
| Starter | 1,000 credits |
| Growth | 1,000 credits |
| Enterprise | 1,500 credits |

You can monitor your current usage at any time by navigating to **Subscriptions → Billing → Usage → AI Credits**.

## What Happens When AI Credits Are Exhausted

:::warning
When your AI Credits are fully consumed, **only the nodes that use AI Credits will stop working**. The rest of your workflow continues to run without interruption.
:::

- AI-Enabled Nodes (e.g., nodes using an AI model, AI Agents) will fail to execute until credits are replenished.
- Non-AI nodes in the same workflow are unaffected and will continue processing normally.
- To resume AI-Enabled Node execution, either wait for your monthly credits to reset or purchase an AI Credit pack.

## Extra AI Credits

If you need more AI Credits before your monthly allowance resets, you can purchase a one-time credit pack.

### Available Credit Packs

| Pack | Credits | Price |
|------|---------|-------|
| Starter Pack | 4,000 credits | $20 |
| Growth Pack | 10,000 credits | $50 (Recommended) |
| Pro Pack | 20,000 credits | $100 |

:::info
Credit packs are **not** monthly. Purchased credits are valid until your annual subscription renews — they do not roll over to the next subscription period.
:::

### How Credits Are Consumed

Credits are always drawn in the following order:

1. **Monthly allowance first** — your plan's monthly credits are used up before any pack credits are touched.
2. **Credit pack next** — once your monthly allowance is exhausted, AI nodes automatically draw from your purchased pack (if one exists).

### How to Buy a Credit Pack

1. Navigate to **Subscriptions → Billing → Usage** in the platform.
2. Scroll to the **AI Credits** section and click **Buy more**.
3. Select your preferred credit pack from the dropdown.
4. Review the **Total due today** summary, agree to the Terms & Conditions, and click **Proceed to Checkout**.
